v.1.1
Increased the stringency of the detection p-values to increase technical reproducibility and minimize intermediate methylation from low intensity regions related to artifacts, deletions, etc: https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/20/e123/5061974 

v.2
Include multiple new controls, plots. Better discimination of good quality samples. Modified the code to be more RAM efficient.

v.2.1
Minor bug fixes when plotting some quality controls.

v.2.2 
- Minor fix to mdsplotting in case no good samples are present. 
- Report sessioninfo at end.

v.3
- More options when filtering detection p-values, including a filtering of all CpGs below a p-value threshold, or a certain percentage of samples shoing CpGs below a certain p-value cutoff
